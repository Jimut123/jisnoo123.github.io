            I am a first year student in the <a href="https://rkmrc.in/ug-departments/computer-science/" class="college">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://rkmrc.in/" class="college">Ramakrishna Mission Residential College (Autonomous), Narendrapur</a>.
            <br><br>
            I feel myself very fortunate to have the blessings of Sri Ramakrishna, Ma Sarada and Swami Vivekananda. Being a part of the Ramakrishna Mission, I am nurtured with their divine teachings, principles and philosophies.
            <br><br>
            Religion is the manifestation of the divinity already within us.
            <br>
                                                        -Swami Vivekananda
            <br><br>
            The word Jnâna means knowledge. It is derived from the root Jnâ — to know — the same word from which your English word to know is derived. Jnana-Yoga is Yoga by means of knowledge. What is the object of the Jnana-Yoga? Freedom. Freedom from what? Freedom from our imperfections, freedom from the misery of life.
            <br>
                                                        -Swami Vivekananda
